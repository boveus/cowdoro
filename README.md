If you practice the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to make sure you take breaks, this is a fun way to ensure you are actually taking them.  I have found that the quotes require enough concentration and are interesting enough to take me away from my code long enough for me to take a pomodoro.
